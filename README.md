[Code Hunt](https://www.codehunt.com/) is a serious educational game which has been played by over 140,000 students and enthusiasts over the past year. In the process we have collected over 1.5M programs, which we can link to specific users at specific levels of expertise. We hope that researchers will embark on research into the data, discovering how coders code and how technology can be used to make the process more accurate and less painful. Although there has been research on how students code in the past, Microsoft Research is offering a unique opportunity to conduct research on large, common data sets. 

This preview data set contains the programs written by students (only) worldwide during a contest over 48 hours. There are approximately 250 users, 24 puzzles and about 13,000 programs. The Readme file describes the format of the data. Please fill our [quick survey](http://aka.ms/code-hunt-community) to let us know how you are using the dataset, and get updates about new releases of Code Hunt data.
